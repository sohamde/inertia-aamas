# Understanding Norm Change: An Evolutionary Game-Theoretic Approach
by Soham De, Dana S Nau and Michele J Gelfand (University of Maryland)

Source code in Python for running simulations of the model presented in the following paper: [link](http://www.gelfand.umd.edu/papers/De%20Nau%20Gelfand%20Norm%20Change%20AAMAS.pdf). The paper appears in the Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Autonomous Agents & Multiagent Systems (AAMAS), and an extended version will be available soon on arXiv.

This README goes through the functionalities of each file in the source code. The code has been tested with Python version 2.7.8.

---

There are two different settings in the paper:
1. Infinite well-mixed population using the replicator dynamic. Code for this is under the `well_mixed` folder.
2. Structured population (we consider a grid in the paper) with the evolutionary dynamic defined by the Fermi rule. Code for this is under the `structured` folder.

---

Under the folder `well_mixed`, there are two files:
1. `replicator.py`: Norm change on an infinite well-mixed population using the replicator dynamic [Figure 4 and 5 in the paper].
2. `mutator_replicator.py`: Norm change on an infinite well-mixed population using the replicator-mutator dynamic [Figure 7 in the paper].

Both these files can be simply run as `python replicator.py` or `python mutator_replicator.py`, with specific settings set inside each file.

---

Under the folder `structured`, there are two main files `main.py` and `main_explore.py`. `main.py` runs the norm change experiments with one structural shock [Figure 6 in the paper]. `main_explore.py` runs the experiments studying the evolution of exploration rates [Figure 8 in the paper]. Both files can be run as follows:

```
python <filename> {a} {b} {network_type} {network_params} {run_no} {c}
```

where `<filename>` can be `main.py` or `main_explore.py`.

`a` and `b` denote the payoffs of the game matrix used.

`network_type` denotes the type of network to be used. `globals.py` contains the various types of networks supported. We used a `grid` network for our experiments.

`network_params` denotes the parameters of the network type. For a `grid` network, it should contain the rows and columns of the grid, separated by a comma, without spaces. For example, for a `grid` network of 20 rows and 30 columns, we would denote `network_params` as `20,30`.

`run_no` denotes a unique identifier for that particular run.

`c` denotes the need for coordination in the game matrix.

The rest of the settings can be set in `globals.py`. The specific settings required for `main_explore.py`, such as the list of exploration rates, are also set in `globals.py`.

An example run of the norm change experiment would be:

```
python main.py 0.4 0.6 grid 30,20 0 1.0
```

Here `a = 0.4`, `b = 0.6`, with network type `grid` with 30 rows and 20 columns, run number 0 and `c = 1.0`.

---

Each run of `main.py` produces one output file `actions_*` under the folder `stats/norm_change/`. Each run of `main_explore.py` produces two output files `actions_*` and `mu_*` under the folder `stats/exploration/`.

`actions_*` stores the proportions of agents playing the two norms at each iteration.

`mu_*` stores the proportion of agents with each exploration rate at each iteration.

Typically, each particular setting will be run multiple times (say for run numbers from 1 to 100), and then all these runs would be averaged together using a separate script. In our paper, we averaged a 100 runs together.

---

For plots, run `python plot_graphs.py`. The specific run to be plotted can be set inside the file.

The functions of the other files that `main.py` or `main_explore.py` uses while running a simulation:

* create_network.py: defines functions for using different network types.
* game_phase.py: defines a method that controls the game phase of the evolutionary model.
* globals.py: initializes global variables for the simulation run. Can be used to set values such as the total iterations to run, the list of exploration rates to use, etc.
* network_agent.py: defines the agent type class.
* place_agents.py: defines methods that determine the type of agents that are placed on the nodes of the network.
* reproduction.py: defines the reproduction dynamic of the evolutionary model.
* stats_files.py: aggregates and saves the different statistics of each iteration in the output files.
* two_player_game.py: defines a class which implements a two player game between two agents on the network.
